# FarmXchange Project

FarmXchange is an e-commerce platform that connects farmers directly with customers, enabling them to sell agricultural products without intermediaries. This project provides an online marketplace where farmers can list their produce, and consumers can purchase them in wholesale or retail quantities.

  - **models/**: Contains data models representing the database tables.
  - **routers/**: Defines the API routes for the application.
  - **schemas/**: Contains Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
  - **database.py**: Contains the database connection logic.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the backend application.

- **README.md**: Documentation specific to the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React. It provides the user interface for the application.

- **public/**: Contains static files.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the React application.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **components/**: Contains React components.
    - **App.js**: Main App component.
