Key Features Added:
Dynamic Product Fetching:

Fetches products from a backend API (/api/products) with pagination, filtering, and sorting.

Uses axios for API requests.

Filtering and Sorting:

Users can filter products by category and price range.

Products can be sorted by price or name in ascending or descending order.

Pagination:

Displays products in pages and allows users to navigate between pages.

Loading and Error States:

Shows a loading message while fetching data.

Displays an error message if the API request fails.

Responsive Design:

Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring the page is responsive and looks good on all devices.

Product Cards:

Each product is displayed in a card with an image, name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

Backend API Example (for Reference):
Here‚Äôs an example of what the backend API (/api/products) might return:

json
Copy
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Fresh Apples",
      "description": "Crisp and juicy apples from local farms.",
      "price": 5.99,
      "image": "https://example.com/apples.jpg",
      "category": "fruits"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Organic Carrots",
      "description": "Fresh organic carrots, rich in vitamins.",
      "price": 3.49,
      "image": "https://example.com/carrots.jpg",
      "category": "vegetables"
    }
  ],
  "totalPages": 5
}
Next Steps:
Integrate with Backend:

Replace the placeholder API endpoint (/api/products) with your actual backend endpoint.

Add Cart Functionality:

Implement a cart system to allow users to add products to their cart.

Enhance UI:

Add animations, hover effects, and more interactive elements to make the page livelier.

Testing:

Write unit tests for the component using Jest and React Testing Library.
